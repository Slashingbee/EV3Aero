## How to Contribute

### 1. **Fork the Repository**
To begin contributing, the first step is to **fork** the repository. This creates a personal copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

#### Steps:
1. Go to the [EV3Aero repository](https://github.com/slashingbee/EV3Aero).
2. Click on the **"Fork"** button in the top-right corner to create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

---

### 2. **Clone Your Fork**
Once you've forked the repository, clone it to your local machine so that you can start making changes. ***(optional, but makes it easier!!)***

#### Steps:
1. In your terminal, run the following command to clone the official repo (can be the fork you just made.):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/slashingbee/EV3Aero.git
   cd EV3Aero
   ```

---

### 3. **Create a New Branch**
Now, create a new branch in your fork where you can work on your changes.

#### Steps:
1. Create and switch to a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
   ```

---

### 4. **Make Your Changes**
On your new branch, make the necessary changes. Whether it’s adding a new feature, fixing a bug, or updating the documentation, make sure to test your changes before committing them.

---

### 5. **Commit Your Changes**
Once you've made and tested your changes, commit them with a descriptive message to explain what changes you’ve made.

#### Example:
```bash
git commit -m "Add unofficial components"
```

---

### 6. **Push Your Changes**
Push the changes in your branch to your fork on GitHub.

#### Example:
```bash
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
```

---

### 7. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**  
Once your changes are pushed to GitHub, it’s time to create a **Pull Request** (PR) to submit your work.

#### Steps:
1. Go to the **[EV3Aero repository](https://github.com/slashingbee/EV3Aero)**.
2. Click on the **"Pull Requests"** tab.
3. Click the **"New Pull Request"** button.
4. Ensure that the request is going to the "contrib" branch of the official repo! **Only that will be accepted as a pull request.**
5. In the PR description, provide:
   - A summary of the changes.
   - The problem your changes solve (if applicable).
   - Any testing or validation you’ve performed.
   - Reference any relevant issues by mentioning the issue number (e.g., `Fixes #123`) If needed.
6. Submit your pull request.

While contributions are always welcome, please note that pull requests will be reviewed and may or may not be merged based on quality, relevance, and alignment with the project’s goals.

---

## Code of Conduct

## Additional Guidelines

- **Issue Reporting**: If you find a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue first. This helps avoid duplicated effort and allows others to review the issue.
- **Documentation**: If your change introduces new functionality, remember to update the documentation as necessary. This may include the `README.md` or other relevant files. (However i may use my own "README" files, for safety. So it may or may not be merged.)
